Welcome! It's great to have you here. This page provides information about the seminars regularly organized by Bilecik Algebra & Number Theory Team (BANT). These seminars cover various important disciplines of mathematics, especially Number Theory.

Everyone is invited to attend! This academic year, all seminars will be held via Zoom. Zoom links will be shared one day before each seminar. To register, please feel free to contact us at [ilker.inam at gmail.com].

We look forward to the opportunity to meet face to face and turn coffee meetings into theorems as soon as possible.


Kind regards,

| Date | Time | Speaker | Affiliation | Title | Abstract |
|------|---------|-------|-------------|-------|----------|
| 15/10/2024    | 10:00 İstanbul / 11:00 Berlin / 18:00 Sydney / 12:00 Londra    | Igor Shparlinski     | University of New South Wales  |  Moments and non-vanishing of $L$-functions over thin subgroups  | Moments and non-vanishing of $L$-functions over thin subgroups. We obtain an asymptotic formula for all moments of Dirichlet $L$-functions $L(1,\chi)$ modulo $p$ when averaged over a subgroup of characters $\chi$ of size $(p-1)/d$ with $\varphi(d)=o(\log p)$. Assuming the infinitude of Mersenne primes, the range of our result is optimal and improves and generalises the previous result of S.~Louboutin and M.~Munsch (2022) for second moments. We also give an asymptotic formula for the second moment of $L(1/2,\chi)$ over subgroups of characters of similar size. This leads to non-vanishing results which in some cases improve those of E. Fouvry, E. Kowalski and P. Michel (2023). Additionally, we prove that, in both cases, we can take much smaller subgroups for almost all primes $p$. Our method relies on pointwise and average estimates on small solutions of linear congruences which in turn leads us to use and modify some results of J.~Bourgain, S.~V.~Konyagin and I.~E.~Shparlinski (2008) on product sets of Farey fractions. Joint work with Marc Munsch.   |
| 12/11/2024  | 19:00 Istanbul / 17:00 Berlin / 16:00 London |  Florian Luca | Stellenbosch University         |On a question of Douglass and Ono| It is known that the partition function \( p(n) \) obeys Benford’s law in any integer base \( b \geq 2 \). A similar result was obtained by Douglass and Ono for the plane partition function \( PL(n) \) in a recent paper. In their paper, Douglass and Ono asked for an explicit version of this result. In particular, given an integer base \( b \geq 2 \) and a string \( f \) of digits in base \( b \), they asked for an explicit value \( N(b, f) \) such that there exists \( n \leq N(b, f) \) with the property that \( PL(n) \) starts with the string \( f \) when written in base \( b \). In my talk, I will present an explicit value for \( N(b, f) \) both for the partition function \( p(n) \) as well as for the plane partition function \( PL(n) \). | 
| 17/12/2024   | Istanbul 16:00, Tokyo 22:00, London 13:00 , Berlin 14:00   |Ade Irma Suriajaya | Kyushu University  | Pair correlation of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function, zero density and simple zeros  |  Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), Montgomery (1973) proved a theorem concerning the pair correlation of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. One consequence of this theorem was that, under RH, at least 2/3 of the zeros are simple. We show that this theorem of Montgomery holds unconditionally. In an earlier paper, as an application, under a much weaker hypothesis than RH that all the zeros lie within a narrow vertical box centered on the critical line, we showed that at least 61.7% of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are simple. We can further weaken the hypothesis using a density hypothesis. Recently we were able to improve a little bit on this proportion, and furthermore found a connection to finding proportion of zeros on the critical line. Inspired by a recent preprint of J. Maynard and K. Pratt, we can additionally weaken our assumption by copying the box finitely many times. This is joint work with Siegfred Alan C. Baluyot, Daniel Alan Goldston, and Caroline L. Turnage-Butterbaugh. |
| 14/01/2025  | Istanbul 16:00, London 13:00, Berlin 14:00, Tokyo 22:00     | Cem Yalçın Yıldırım   |   Boğaziçi University  | Some analogues of pair correlation of zeta zeros   | An alternative way to carry out Montgomery's original calculation of the pair correlation of zeta zeros allows us to obtain some other analogous results. In particular, we can approach the problems of correlating zeta zeros and relative maxima on the critical line, and the pair correlation of these maxima.     |
| 25/02/2025 | Istanbul 16:00, London 13:00, Berlin 14:00, Tokyo 22:00     | A. Muhammed Uludağ | Galatasaray University         | Dyer's outer automorphism of PGL(2,Z) and the codenominator | The codenominator is a function F that extends the Fibonacci sequence to the index set of positive rational numbers. Many known Fibonacci identities carry over to the codenominator. One can express Dyer's outer automorphism of the extended modular group PGL(2, Z) in terms of F. This automorphism can be viewed as an automorphism group of the trivalent tree. The real -covariant modular function Jimm J on the real line  is defined via the codenominator. J relates the Stern-Brocot tree to the Bird tree. Jimm induces an involution of the moduli space of rank-2 pseudolattices and is related to the arithmetic of real quadratic irrationals.    |

        <td>Cyclotomic points on abelian varieties</td>
        <td>Roughly 30 years ago, I proved: Suppose that A is an abelian variety over a number field K. Then A has only a finite number of torsion points defined over the maximal cyclotomic extension of K. After explaining the ingredients of the proof, I will highlight some questions suggested by this theorem. One natural project is to compute the group of cyclotomic torsion points in some specific examples. If A is J<sub>0</sub>(N), where N is a prime number, then the group of torsion points on A over the maximal cyclotomic extension of Q is the kernel of the Eisenstein ideal on A.</td>
