Welcome! It's great to have you here. This page provides information about the seminars regularly organized by Bilecik Algebra & Number Theory Team (BANT). These seminars cover various important disciplines of mathematics, especially Number Theory.

Everyone is invited to attend! This academic year, all seminars will be held via Zoom. Zoom links will be shared one day before each seminar. To register, please feel free to contact us at [ilker.inam at gmail.com].

We look forward to the opportunity to meet face to face and turn coffee meetings into theorems as soon as possible.

Kind regards,
BANT Team

## *BANT/Working Group Seminar*

In these seminars, we examine Algebra and number theory topics, and our goals are to increase our mathematical maturity and say hello to new bridges in mathematics. We will use book D. S Malik, John M. Mordeson and M. K. Sen, *Fundamentals of Abstract Algebra.* in these seminars
