Welcome! It's great to have you here. This page provides information about the seminars regularly organized by Bilecik Algebra & Number Theory Team (BANT). These seminars cover various important disciplines of mathematics, especially Number Theory.

Everyone is invited to attend! This academic year, all seminars will be held via Zoom. Zoom links will be shared one day before each seminar. To register, please feel free to contact us at [ilker.inam at gmail.com].

We look forward to the opportunity to meet face to face and turn coffee meetings into theorems as soon as possible.


Kind regards,
BANT Team

## *BANT Working Group Seminars*

| 15/10/2024    | TBA     | Igor Shparlinski     | University of New South Wales  |  Moments and non-vanishing of $L$-functions over thin subgroups  | Moments and non-vanishing of $L$-functions over thin subgroups. We obtain an asymptotic formula for all moments of Dirichlet \( L \)-functions \( L(1,\chi) \) modulo \( p \) when averaged over a subgroup of characters \( \chi \) of size \( \frac{p-1}{d} \) with \( \varphi(d)=o(\log p) \). Assuming the infinitude of Mersenne primes, the range of our result is optimal and improves and generalises the previous result of S.~Louboutin and M.~Munsch (2022) for second moments. We also give an asymptotic formula for the second moment of \( L(1/2,\chi) \) over subgroups of characters of similar size. This leads to non-vanishing results which in some cases improve those of E. Fouvry, E. Kowalski and P. Michel (2023). Additionally, we prove that, in both cases, we can take much smaller subgroups for almost all primes \( p \). Our method relies on pointwise and average estimates on small solutions of linear congruences which in turn leads us to use and modify some results of J.~Bourgain, S.~V.~Konyagin and I.~E.~Shparlinski (2008) on product sets of Farey fractions.

In particular, I will discuss the following two applications: a new L-function free approach to Linnik's problem of bounding the least prime p such that p ≡ a (mod q) (obtaining the bound p << q<sup>350</sup>) and a new L-function free proof that the interval (x−x<sup>39/40</sup>, x] contains primes for every large x.</td>

According to the remaining time, we will explain how to obtain the generator functions of cylindrical decompositions in different sections and give examples. This study is a joint work with Halime Ömrüuzun Seyrek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14514">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14514</a>).</td>

He explicitly showed the 'modularity' of this function for n=3,4. In this talk, I report on joint work with Alfio Fabio La Rosa and Chandrashekhar Khare, in which we treat the case n=5 in several different ways.</td>

In this talk, the speaker will discuss new and old results about the partition function modulo 2 and 4, and will offer a few precise open questions with the idea of catalyzing work in the area.</td>

Then A has only a finite number of torsion points defined over the maximal cyclotomic extension of K. After explaining the ingredients of the proof, I will highlight some questions suggested by this theorem. One natural project is to compute the group of cyclotomic torsion points in some specific examples. If A is J<sub>0</sub>(N), where N is a prime number, then the group of torsion points on A over the maximal cyclotomic extension of Q is the kernel of the Eisenstein ideal on A.</td>
