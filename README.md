|-------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 15/10/2024  | 10:00 İstanbul / 11:00 Berlin / 18:00 Sydney / 12:00 Londra | Igor Shparlinski  | University of New South Wales | Moments and non-vanishing of L-functions over thin subgroups | Moments and non-vanishing of L-functions over thin subgroups. We obtain an asymptotic formula for all moments of Dirichlet L-functions L(1,χ) modulo p when averaged over a subgroup of characters χ of size (p-1)/d with φ(d)=o(log p). Assuming the infinitude of Mersenne primes, the range of our result is optimal and improves and generalises the previous result of S. Louboutin and M. Munsch (2022) for second moments. We also give an asymptotic formula for the second moment of L(1/2,χ) over subgroups of characters of similar size. This leads to non-vanishing results which in some cases improve those of E. Fouvry, E. Kowalski and P. Michel (2023). Additionally, we prove that, in both cases, we can take much smaller subgroups for almost all primes p. Our method relies on pointwise and average estimates on small solutions of linear congruences which in turn leads us to use and modify some results of J. Bourgain, S. V. Konyagin and I. E. Shparlinski (2008) on product sets of Farey fractions. Joint work with Marc Munsch. |
| 12/11/2024  | 19:00 Istanbul / 17:00 Berlin / 16:00 London | Florian Luca  | Stellenbosch University | On a question of Douglass and Ono | It is known that the partition function <span>p(n)</span> obeys Benford’s law in any integer base <span>b ≥ 2</span>. A similar result was obtained by Douglass and Ono for the plane partition function <span>PL(n)</span> in a recent paper. In their paper, Douglass and Ono asked for an explicit version of this result. In particular, given an integer base <span>b ≥ 2</span> and a string <span>f</span> of digits in base <span>b</span>, they asked for an explicit value <span>N(b, f)</span> such that there exists <span>n ≤ N(b, f)</span> with the property that <span>PL(n)</span> starts with the string <span>f</span> when written in base <span>b</span>. In my talk, I will present an explicit value for <span>N(b, f)</span> both for the partition function <span>p(n)</span> as well as for the plane partition function <span>PL(n)</span>. |
| 17/12/2024  | 16:00 Istanbul / 22:00 Tokyo / 13:00 London / 14:00 Berlin | Ade Irma Suriajaya | Kyushu University  | Pair correlation of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function, zero density and simple zeros | Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis (RH), Montgomery (1973) proved a theorem concerning the pair correlation of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. One consequence of this theorem was that, under RH, at least 2/3 of the zeros are simple. We show that this theorem of Montgomery holds unconditionally. In an earlier paper, as an application, under a much weaker hypothesis than RH that all the zeros lie within a narrow vertical box centered on the critical line, we showed that at least 61.7% of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are simple. We can further weaken the hypothesis using a density hypothesis. Recently we were able to improve a little bit on this proportion, and furthermore found a connection to finding proportion of zeros on the critical line. Inspired by a recent preprint of J. Maynard and K. Pratt, we can additionally weaken our assumption by copying the box finitely many times. This is joint work with Siegfred Alan C. Baluyot, Daniel Alan Goldston, and Caroline L. Turnage-Butterbaugh. |
| 14/01/2025  | 16:00 Istanbul / 13:00 London / 14:00 Berlin / 22:00 Tokyo | Cem Yalçın Yıldırım | Boğaziçi University | Some analogues of pair correlation of zeta zeros | An alternative way to carry out Montgomery's original calculation of the pair correlation of zeta zeros allows us to obtain some other analogous results. In particular, we can approach the problems of correlating zeta zeros and relative maxima on the critical line, and the pair correlation of these maxima. |
| 25/02/2025  | 16:00 Istanbul / 13:00 London / 14:00 Berlin / 22:00 Tokyo | A. Muhammed Uludağ | Galatasaray University | Dyer's outer automorphism of PGL(2,Z) and the codenominator | The codenominator is a function <span>F</span> that extends the Fibonacci sequence to the index set of positive rational numbers. Many known Fibonacci identities carry over to the codenominator. One can express Dyer's outer automorphism of the extended modular group PGL(2, Z) in terms of <span>F</span>. This automorphism can be viewed as an automorphism group of the trivalent tree. The real-covariant modular function <span>Jimm J</span> on the real line is defined via the codenominator. <span>J</span> relates the Stern-Brocot tree to the Bird tree. <span>Jimm</span> induces an involution of the moduli space of rank-2 pseudolattices and is related to the arithmetic of real quadratic irrationals. |
| 25/03/2025  | 16:00 Istanbul / 13:00 London / 14:00 Berlin / 22:00 Tokyo | Özlem İmamoğlu | ETH Zurich | A Lyapunov exponent attached to modular functions  | In joint work with Paloma Bengoechea and Sebastian Herrero we recently defined  a Lyapunov exponent attached to modular functions  and proved its properties. Our work was motivated by the work of Spalding and Veselov as well as conjectures of Kaneko on the values of modular functions at real quadratic irrationalities. In this talk I will first explain the results of Spalding and Veselov and the conjectures of Kaneko. I will then talk about the new results. |
| 27/05/2025  | Istanbul 14:30, London 12:30, Berlin 13:30, Tokyo 20:30, Sydney 21:30, New York 07:30  | John Voight | University of Sydney | Hilbert modular forms obtained from orthogonal modular forms on quaternary lattices | We make explicit the relationship between Hilbert modular forms and orthogonal modular forms arising from positive definite quaternary lattices over the ring of integers of a totally real number field.  Our work uses the Clifford algebra, and it generalizes that of Ponomarev, Bocherer--Schulze-Pillot, and others by allowing for general discriminant, weight, and class group of the base ring.  This is joint work with Eran Assaf, Dan Fretwell, Colin Ingalls, Adam Logan, and Spencer Secord. |
| 10/06/2025  |16:00 Istanbul / 15:00 Berlin / 14:00 Londra / 22:00 Tokyo / 09:00 New York / 23:00 Sydney | Ian Kiming | University of Copenhagen |  Eisenstein series and overconvergence. | I will talk about a series of works from recent years on the rate of overconvergence of certain modular functions that arise from classical Eisenstein series. The question arises because these rates have implications for the finer structure of the Coleman-Mazur eigencurve. Specifically, proving explicit bounds for the rates played a pivotal role in the proofs of "halo" type conjectures for p=2 and p=3 by Buzzard-Kilford and Roe, respectively. Those theorems lead Coleman to formulate a general conjecture for all primes p, and a recent (2025) theorem by myself together with B. Advocaat and G. Wiese proved a version of this conjecture. This new work builds on and uses previous work by myself together with N. Rustom. My aim in this talk will primarily be to explain the content of these results. I will start the talk at a very basic level, talking about overconvergent modular forms and "Katz expansions" in very concrete terms that are accessible to anyone who knows about modular forms. At the end I might be able to sketch some of the ideas that go into the proofs. |

        <td>The partition function modulo 2 and 4</td>
        <td>The Ramanujan congruences for the partition function have an extraordinary legacy in mathematics. These days research abounds with new congruences for various sorts of restricted partition functions. Unfortunately, very little is known about p(n) modulo powers of 2. In this talk, the speaker will discuss new and old results about the partition function modulo 2 and 4, and will offer a few precise open questions with the idea of catalyzing work in the area.</td>

        <td>Cyclotomic points on abelian varieties</td>
        <td>Roughly 30 years ago, I proved: Suppose that A is an abelian variety over a number field K. Then A has only a finite number of torsion points defined over the maximal cyclotomic extension of K. After explaining the ingredients of the proof, I will highlight some questions suggested by this theorem. One natural project is to compute the group of cyclotomic torsion points in some specific examples. If A is J<sub>0</sub>(N), where N is a prime number, then the group of torsion points on A over the maximal cyclotomic extension of Q is the kernel of the Eisenstein ideal on A.</td>
